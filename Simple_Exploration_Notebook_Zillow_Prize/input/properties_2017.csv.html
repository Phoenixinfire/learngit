Ensuring homeowners have a trusted way to monitor this asset is incredibly important. The Zestimate was created to give consumers as much information as possible about homes and the housing market, marking the first time consumers had access to this type of home value information at no cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zestimates” are estimated home values based on 7.5 million statistical and machine learning models that analyze hundreds of data points on each property.   And, by continually improving the median margin of error (from 14% at the onset to 5% today), Zillow has since become established as one of the largest, most trusted marketplaces for real estate information in the U.S. and a leading example of impactful machine learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZillow Prize, a competition with a one million dollar grand prize, is challenging the data science community to help push the accuracy of the Zestimate even further. Winning algorithms stand to impact the home values of  110M homes across the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this million-dollar competition, participants will develop an algorithm that makes predictions about the future sale prices of homes. The contest is structured into two rounds, the qualifying round which opens May 24, 2017 and the private round for the 100 top qualifying teams that opens  on Feb 1st, 2018. In the qualifying round, you’ll be building a model to improve the Zestimate residual error. In the final round, you’ll build a home valuation algorithm from the ground up, using external data sources to help engineer new features that give your model an edge over the competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause real estate transaction data is public information, there will be a three-month sales tracking period after each competition round closes where your predictions will be evaluated against the actual sale prices of the homes. The final leaderboard won’t be revealed until the close of the sales tracking period.\u003c/p\u003e","mimeType":"text/html","name":"description","isPublished":false},"rules":{"id":18716,"postId":71370,"content":"\u003c!-- Begin Base Rules --\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOne account per participant\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot sign up to Kaggle from multiple accounts and therefore you cannot submit from multiple accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNo private sharing outside teams\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrivately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted.
